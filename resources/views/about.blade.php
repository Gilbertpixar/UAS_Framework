                        <h3><b>our clinic is made for you to be smiling all the time</b></h3>
                        <p>gigiku is dental clinic base on cirebon. Originally, it was a heritage property that belonged
                            to our family, but we chose to transform the entire ground van to a dentistry clinic because
                            the house has been inactive and unproductive since then. Our mission is to create trust,
                            comfort and serenity for patients in getting dental treatments, and we believe with a design
                            created by our designers, can leverage our mission. To begin with, I believe the entire
                            process was a lot of fun. We had the liberty to apply our design sensibilities to the
                            project while also having the opportunity to experiment with the variety of concepts. We
                            wanted to embrace the key notion of a clean, bright and soft interior so that people can
                            perceive this project as an example of how dentist clinics operate. The facade was created
                            with the intention of resembling a toothlike facilitation. To symbolize the thoughts, we use
                            all the white base material from the outside to the interior. Turban is well known for its
                            drizzly weather. Rather than avoiding this natural value, we are embracing it as an extra
                            source of light that has come through the building. Another element to consider was the
                            lighting. We use spotlight and indirect light to capture the best view of our interior and
                            exterior to embrace the natural light and warm mood.</p>
